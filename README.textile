h2. git_local

git_local is intended to provide a browser based way of creating and viewing your local git repositories.

it's basically an excuse to play with grit and sinatra, and it's not quite as useless as it was yesterday...

h3. gems

* sinatra
* RedCloth
* grit
* mime-types
* haml 2.x
* open4
* passenger (optional)

h3. Other Dependencies

* pygments "http://pygments.org":http://pygments.org

h3. Usage

* run the setup utility

<pre><code>
# from the git_local directory run...
rake setup
# ...and follow the prompts.  git_local uses Rack, so if you plan to run
# git_local on a server that supports Rack middleware, you have the option
# to enable Basic HTTP Authentication. If you're not using Rack, just answer 'no'
# when prompted to setup HTTP Authentication
</code></pre>

h4. Run git_local in development mode (starts git_local on port 4567)
* start the server:

<pre><code>
ruby git_local.rb
</code></pre>

h4. Run git_local in production with passenger!

git_local runs on "Sinatra":http://github.com/bmizerany/sinatra, and Sinatra makes deploying with "Phusion Passenger":http://modrails.com a cinch.
